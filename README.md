Converting Octave code to JS

Experimenting with html5-boilerplate code and parcel.

Using mathjs (https://mathjs.org/) and ml-util (https://github.com/gulfaraz/ml-util) to assist.

Issues with parcel and hosting so clone this repo and run 'npm run dev' to experiment!

Outputs prediction to console right now. Will update soon to display on the page.
